    "The [PlantCV project](http://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/) is an open-source imaging processing package for plant phenotyping. The Jupyter notebooks contained here are the interactive version of some of the [PlantCV documentation](http://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The Jupyter notebooks can be used directly in an executable environment provided by [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), or they can be cloned and run locally.\n",

    "Also, feel free to upload your own images and adjust parameters and workflows to fit them. Any images/Jupyter notebooks/data can be downloaded. \n",
